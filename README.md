# Short CV in Markdown

> Based on templates by [svmiller](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) and [ryanpeek](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv). The only two files that are required to run the RMarkdown is `cv-template.Rmd` and `cv-template.tex`, which should be stored in the same directory.
